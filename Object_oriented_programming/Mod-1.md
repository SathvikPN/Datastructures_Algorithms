A program can be organized in one of two ways: around its code (what is happening) or around its data (who is being affected).

structured programming: organized around code ("code acting on data")

Object oriented programming: organized around data ("data controlling access to code"). [all OOP languages have three traits in common: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance]

**1. Encapsulation:**
- mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. (`private` `public`)
- object is the device that supports encapsulation. object is a variable of a user-defined type, Each time you define a new type of object, you are creating a new data type.
- Typically, the public parts of an object are used to provide a controlled interface to the private elements of the object.

**2. Polymorphism:**
- "one interface, multiple methods."
- reduce complexity by allowing the same interface to be used to access a general class of actions
- One stack is used for integer values, one for character values, and one for floating-point values. Because of polymorphism, you can define one set of names, push( ) and pop( ), that can be used for all three stacks.
- In C++, both run-time and compile-time polymorphism are supported

**3. Inheritance**
- process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object
- through the use of classifications, an object need only define those qualities that make it unique within its class.
- possible for one object to be a specific instance of a more general case
